Month of code

Day 4: Error
------------

Displays green text in the middle of a black screen. The text flashes in
random colors, jumps randomly and changes some of the letters. All the
effects are random and occur in random intervals.

Default text is "ERROR", but you can provide your own one after the hash,
e.g. [QUESTION AUTHORITY](http://mrozycki.github.io/month-of-code/4-error#question authority).
Bear in mind that the text is capitalized.
